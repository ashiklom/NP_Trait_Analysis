# Editor

> I have received three reviews of your paper, and the reviewers and I appreciate the work you have conducted.
As you will see, the reviews are quite divergent, from positive to more critical.
In light of these reviews, as I will outline below, I am not able to accept your paper in its current form, and invite resubmission of a revised manuscript if you desire.
>
> Reviewer 1 is largely positive and notes a shared concern about the use of respiration vs photosynthesis, and the impact of the trait-filling methods on your results.
Reviewer 2 is also generally positive though very concerned about the use of mass-based vs. area-based physiological metrics.
I do not generally concur with the view that LMA leads to ‘inevitable’ and thus biologically less interesting relationships when using mass-based measures, but you should take these comments into consideration and decide whether to pursue area-based measures as well.
Reviewer 2 provides a number of other useful suggestions.
Reviewer 3 is the most critical and I find myself in agreement with the points raised.
While I appreciate the power of the new generation of hierarchical models, it does seem that the biological questions and the biological implications of the results are sometimes lost sight of.
In particular, reviewer 3 questions the very large number, and non-conventional definition, of PFTs, the definition of biomes, and the overall motivation for the work.
>
> From my own reading, I am strongly concerned about the very small sample sizes, combined with trait-filling of missing data, that mean many PFTs are quite data poor.
I also wonder whether it is really that surprising that relationships observed across broad data ranges break down when the data are aggregated.
I think it is well known that any regression will exhibit less strong results if one samples a narrow range of data.
This makes me wonder whether the results reflect anything particular about the nature of tradeoffs within PFTs or just the fact that species within PFTs are generally similar so we would expect weaker relationships detected within them.
This could be tested quite easily by randomly assigning species to PFTs, either fully at random so they would have small sample sizes but the full spread of the data, on average, or in a stratified random fashion such that species tended to be similar within groups.
Would the results be similar?
If so, are we learning something about PFTs and tradeoffs, or just something about the statistical properties of breaking a large data set into small groups.
Exploration of this question would be a useful ‘null model’ to back up this study.

There were several reasons for the relatively large number of plant functional types in the original manuscript.
For one, such a large number was necessary to explore the different drivers of trait correlation -- for instance, to compare the differences in correlations between biomes versus between growth forms and leaf types.
Furthermore, we were interested in the ability of our hierarchical modeling approach to support efforts to improve representation of biodiversity in models by increasing the number of plant functional types [e.g. @more_pfts].
In particular, we note that some ecosystem models are parameterized for individual species [e.g. Linkages, @linkages; LANDIS, @landis].

However, we agree the number of PFTs selected and their resulting low sample sizes made it possible that many of our results were a mere statistical artifact rather than ecologically meaningful.
To address this concern, and to make the paper more directly applicable to ecosystem modeling, we replaced our PFT scheme with the scheme used by the Community Land Model [CLM 4.5, @clm45_note].
This brings the number of PFTs down to 14.
We have provided additional details about how we assigned species to PFTs in the methods (Section 2.2, "Plant functional types").

> Finally, I think it is important to be more specific about just how the implications of this work are important for modeling, or for other biological implications.
Most importantly, for ecosystem models it is the PFT means that are most important, and it appears that your models suggest only very small changes in estimating means.
In that the analysis does not suggest a particular problem with current approaches.
Alternatively, if you can point to specific contexts where trait values are estimated or modeled among species within functional groups and how these methods would lead to different estimates, please be more specific about the contexts of such work.

Besides the above change in the methods, we have significantly revised the text--particularly the discussion section--to be more directly relevant to both the modeling community and to plant ecologists in general.
In the first part of our discussion (section 4.1, "Variation in trait means among PFTs"), we directly compare our trait estimates to the default parameters in the Community Land Model, and assess the extent to which our observed trends in PFT means match predictions from other studies on global biogeography.
As well, we provide an explicit demonstration of the additional constraint on trait estimates from the multivariate compared to simple univariate models (Figure 3).
In the second part of our discussion (section 4.2, "Trait correlations and leaf economics"), we highlight several specific instances where our results challenge predictions from the leaf economic spectrum and propose explanations grounded in ecophysiology and supported by specific references.


# Reviewer 1

> This paper looks at how the well known (almost textbook knowledge at this point) leaf economic spectrum (LES) scales within and between functional groups.
They find that the LES is primarily a cross-functional group result.
The LES does not exist in any generality within a functional group.
I found this a very nice paper.
The question is important.
Others have attacked this somewhat indirectly.
But the large data size and the directness of the tests make this paper novel and important.
I found the methods very convincing.
Comparing an analysis at the species level with an analysis using species nested within functional groups is exactly the right approach and gives a convincing answer.
>
> 1) My main feedback, is that I think the authors are not careful and consistent to describe the within functional group and across functional group analyses (the latter case having two versions, the nested version and the unnested version).
The authors need to pick on a sensible name for each of these and then use it repeatedly.
I have highlighted just some of the places this occurs in the specific issues below, but it is more generally and the paper needs to be edited start to finish with this in mind. 

In the revised version of the manuscript, we have streamlined the results to make this less of an issue.
Specifically, in both new figures that compare within- and across-PFT estimates (Figures 4 and 5), we use the same terminology ("global" to refer to the multivariate model fit to pooled data, and all within-PFT results based on the hierarchical model), which we also clearly define in the methods (section 2.3.3, "Analysis of results").

> 2) Line 131 - Leaf Dark Respiration is a fairly rare actor in analyses of LES.
Maximum photosynthetic rate is much more common (although I'm sure these are correlated).
The authors own introduciton to LES on lines 69-70 mentions Amax but not dark respiration.
An acknowledgment and justification for using dark respiration over Amax is needed.

We have added a paragraph to the methods (section 2.1, "Trait data") explaining our rationale for not choosing $A_{max}$.
However, we agree that examining traits more directly related to photosynthesis is valuable, and therefore have included both $V_{c,max}$ and $J_{max}$.
Leaf dark respiration appears as one of the the original traits defining the leaf economic spectrum [@wright_worldwide_2004], and has been identified as a key parameter in Earth System Models that requires additional constraint [@atkin_2014_improving; @atkin_2016_global].

> 3) Line 150 forward - to interpret the methods in this area I really wanted to know how many plant functional groups there are. 
I can kind of guess it from a later table (but it is not completely clear to me there). Can you spell this out here.

We have added Table 1, which explicitly labels our 14 plant functional types (PFTs) and how many species are in each, and Figure 1, which shows the sample sizes for each PFT-trait combination.
We have also re-written the text describing our method for assigning PFTs to make our approach clearer.

> 4) Line 150 - can you give a justification for assuming MVN across plant functional groups?

We selected the multivariate normal distribution for several reasons.
From an algorithmic standpoint, it allows for highly efficient Gibbs sampling, which makes our approach considerably more computationally tractable.
Second, the parameters of the multivariate normal distribution--the mean vector and variance-covariance matrix--have intuitive interpretations, unlike other multivariate distributions.
Finally, the multivariate normal distribution is closely related to standard frequentist statistics that have extensively been applied to trait studies at all scales.

> 5) Line 179-184 - I am always suspicious of trait filling methods.
Can you show your results are robust to choices here?
Especially to an analysis with no trait filling?
One would think this should be possible in a Bayesian world especially.

Trait filling is fundamental to the multivariate approach used in this paper -- this is precisely the mechanism by which trait observations borrow strength from each other.
For this trait dataset, there is not a single observation that contains all seven of the traits we included.
Therefore, we do not believe a multivariate analysis without trait filling makes sense in the context of this paper.
However, our univariate model by definition does not include any trait filling, so it already serves as a point of comparison.

> 6) Line 198, line 225, line 233, line 241, line 243 line 267 - several  of the places I am not sure which model is being used with which word

These comments are no longer relevant in light of the re-written results and discussion sections.

> 7) Discussion in general - I would have appreciated a little more speculation about mechanisms that cause this "scale-break" in LES.
Conversely some of the rest of the discussion largely repeats the results without adding a lot of value and could be shortened.
I personally was much more interested in the correlation results than the mean estimation results, and I expect most other readers would be too, so you might want to think about adjusting time devoted to each.

We have re-written the discussion to focus more strongly on the ecological basis for the patterns in our results, both in terms of comparing PFT means and pairwise correlations.
We agree that the ecological relevance of the correlation results may be somewhat higher, and therefore we spend more time on them in our discussion.
However, our mean estimates and the relative constraint on them from our different models is highly relevant to ecological modelling, so we feel strongly that at least some discussion of these points is valuable as well.

# Reviewer 2

> I like the motivation for the study and the straightforward statistical approach and presentation of results. Well done.
The study objectives are timely, sufficiently novel, and useful.
The authors effectively build on body of work that is described well in their introduction and discussion.
The analysis is rigorous and a contributes a useful statistical approach to the literature on foliar trait analysis.
Demonstrating the hierarchical analysis of traits between and within PFTs is a great contribution to our understanding of trait ecology.
Having said that, though, I have one major criticism and a minor query/suggestion about the overall study:
>
> 1. Why did you use mass-based (instead of area-based) nutrient concentrations and dark respiration rates?
You don’t justify the choice, but you should, because this makes a crucial difference for interpreting trait correlations and trait distributions among and within different groups.
Given the strength and utility of your statistical approach and ideas, I think you are missing useful information by relying on mass-based values.
What you gain are pretty pictures because mass-based correlations are tight in most groups of plants by mathematical necessity because they are all inextricably linked to LMA, and LMA varies interspecifically in many ecologically relevant groups of plants.
It’s just not that interesting, in my opinion, to reproduce strong(ish) mass-based trait correlations, but I’m very interested in your results regarding LL-LMA and look forward to seeing what your straightforward statistical approach will reveal for area-based or LMA-independent trait data (see below).

In the revised manuscript, we perform our analysis on both mass- and area-based traits.
Like the editor, we disagree that mass-based correlations are tight "by mathematical necessity", and, after comparing our results for mass- and area-based traits, we conclude that analysis of both is ecologically relevant.

> 2. Why didn’t you include photosynthetic rate as a variable in your analysis?
You certainly don’t have to, but I was expecting it and was disappointed to discover its absence when I got to the list of your analyzed traits in the methods section.
My perception is that data in TRY for maximum net photosynthetic assimilation rate (Amax) is better and more abundant than dark respiration rate data, and it’s certainly variable across species and interesting, so it seems odd to me that you didn’t analyze it, too.
If it wouldn’t be a huge lift to add Amax, maybe do it?
It’s great, by the way, that you use TRY data in your study.

See response to point 2 of reviewer 1 (above).

> 1. Introduction
> 
> a. Line 63: I loathe the phrase “Plant functional traits provide a useful framework for…” Traits do not “provide” a framework. 
They may constitute a framework, but what do you mean by “framework”?
Please use a more careful description here.
I know a huge fraction of ecologists are throwing “framework” into proposals, manuscripts, and talks, but it’s an unfortunate trend toward shiny-but-sloppy language, usually used when the person making assertions about the “framework” can’t effectively articulate exactly how the thing in question (traits) actually can accomplish the scale transition(s) supposedly in the “framework.”
I am confident you can introduce the utility of traits more precisely!
In fact, I think in the line 63 sentence, you can just say “…traits are potentially useful for linking…” and you’ve accomplished that.

We have revised this sentence accordingly.

> b. Line 67: Perhaps specify that plant strategies are life history strategies?

We disagree.
"Life history strategies" has a narrower definition that does not encompass the scope of this work, specifically because we are modeling not just species means but observations on multiple individuals of each species.

> c. Line 69: I disagree with the word “efficient” as a description of high photosynthetic rate.
Maximum photosynthetic assimilation rate (what you’re talking about) is different from photosynthetic efficiency (with respect to what?
Water or nutrients or initial carbon investment?).
Also, moving to line 70, I think your existing language describes a confusing dichotomy because you use nutrient concentrations and a gas exchange rate on one hand and LMA and longevity on the other.
Also, it’s a little odd that you use photosynthetic rate in your description of the LES considering you don’t use it as a variable in your study.
Please revise your description of the leaf economics spectrum (LES).
Incidentally, though, I like the word “sturdy” here to describe the high LMA leaves. It made me smile.

We have revised this language to "productive but short-lived leaves versus less productive but sturdy and long-lived leaves", which avoids this confusing dichotomy and generally covers the range of traits we use.

> d. Line 99: Good description of the background material motivating the study

> e. The last paragraph of the introduction (starting at line 114) is a great description of your motivation and research approach.

Given that these two paragraphs worked well, we have kept them without significant revision.

> 2. Materials and Methods
> 
> a. Line 130: You listed the inverse units for LMA. The LMA units should be mg mm-2, not mm2 mg-1 (those are the units for specific leaf area (SLA), the inverse of LMA).
Looking at the results, I can see that you did in fact use LMA and not SLA, which is great, because I find LMA more intuitive.

We have fixed references to units throughout the paper.
However, in the revised analysis, we have switched from LMA to SLA.
While we agree that LMA may be more intuitive, the use of SLA allows us to directly compare our estimates to those of CLM.

> b. The “Multivariate analysis” section:
All the text here is good but is too sparse.
The models are described clearly but need an explanation and justification of their use.
What does each model tell you?
Why did you make it?
How does each model individually and together help you achieve your research goal of testing your hypothesis?

> c. Line 144-145: I don’t like that x is lowercase in the text and capitalized in the mathematical expression

> d. Line 152: need a bar over mu in the text

> e. Lines 158-161: Edit the bars in your mathematical expressions and text. I don’t think the xi,p in the mathematical expression should have a bar, right? Your mus in the text need bars.

We have revised all of our mathematical notation to be more consistent.

> f. The “Model implementation” section:
>
> i. Yay for Stan!
But they like you to spell it “Stan” instead of “STAN” (http://mc-stan.org/documentation/), so you’ll have to fix that throughout your text.
Thanks for putting your code up online, but I wasn’t sure where to look to find it on the website provided (https://github.com/ashiklom/np_trait_analysis).
Looks like you’ll have to clean that up and provide a better description of the files to make this useful for people to find your code.
Please do this, though, because you’ve obviously done a good job, and it this would be a valuable resource.

In the revised version of the text, we have moved from using Stan to a direct implementation of the sampling algorithms.
This was done primarily to allow efficient filling of missing data, rather than simply omitting missing values, as we had done in the Stan implementation.
However, a side effect of using our own implementation is that the sampling is more efficient, and the underlying code for running the models is somewhat simpler.

To make the code easier to use, we have isolated the code for fitting multivariate and hierarchical models, as well as some associated utilities, into their own R package (`mvtraits`).
We have put considerable effort into making this package more user friendly, both by adding documentation and examples to the package and by making the code design more modular and versatile.

> ii. I liked your treatment of missing trait values (a rampant problem in trait analysis; I hope Stan someday allows NAs; you might mention these 2 points) and this description.
If you don’t already, you should list in the Supplementary materials the sample sizes for each pairwise analysis for each of your 35 PFTs.
Following line 184, though, should x in the mathematical expression have a bar?

Given our new implementation of the missing data model, this comment is no longer relevant.

> g. “Analysis of results” section: Again, the text is fine, but it’s too sparse.
You need to clearly explain how your treatment of the results of your model fitting help you achieve your objectives.

We have provided additional context for all of our analysis in the analysis section.

> i. Line 198 typo: “with-PFT” should be “within-PFT”

This has been revised accordingly.

> ii. Line 208-209: You should move the R citation up to where you first mention R.
I think the TRY data repository information should be moved up to where you introduce the TRY trait data that you used.

We have moved the R reference up accordingly.
However, we have kept the TRY data URL in the same place as the link to code for performing our analyses, as we believe that keeping these two links close together makes it easier for readers to quickly identify the resources needed to reproduce our analyses.

> 3. Results
>
> a. Section “Constraint on estimates….” and Figure 1: You need to provide a biological interpretation of the results presented in Figure 1, both in the text and figure caption.
You show dashed lines for the sample means of the traits but don’t provide any interpretation of what it means for a model joint probability distribution to encompass the sample mean or not.

We have eliminated the corresponding figure, so this comment is no longer relevant.
However, we have included added 1-2 sentences of interpretation to the captions of Figures 3, 4, and 5.

> b. Section “Trait correlation patterns”:
> 
> i. Figure 2 looks great!
In the figure caption, though, you need to put in a sentence about what you want us to learn from this figure.
The hierarchical model results definitely look more like the data than do the multivariate model results.
If you wanted to make this figure smaller, instead of printing the correlation value above the diagonal, you could use the ellipses from one model below the diagonal and the other above.

We have eliminated the corresponding figure, so this comment is no longer relevant.

> ii. First paragraph, about global-scale (starting line 225): Shouldn’t you mention that the hierarchical model results capture patterns in the data much more strongly than do the results from the multivariate model? Why does the hierarchical model perform so much better?

The results have been rewritten entirely, so this comment is no longer relevant, especially given that the hierarchical model does not necessarily perform any better than the multivariate model.

> iii. Line 233-234: awkward language regarding trait relationships. In many cases, and in the figure caption of Fig. 4, I think you can just say “pairwise trait correlation” instead of “among-trait pairwise correlation.”

The results have been rewritten entirely, so this comment is not longer relevant.
However, we have adapted the phrase "pairwise trait correlations" throughout the manuscript.

> iv. Figure 3: Just show panel b; put panel a in the supplement or just say that it’s not shown. And put a sentence in the caption about what interpretation you want us to take away from the figure. You also need to label the x-axis and explain your nomenclature for the trait relationships in the figure (x1.x2).

We have eliminated the corresponding figure, so this comment is no longer relevant.

> v. I really like Figure 4! Again, though, provide some kind of interpretation in the caption.

We have eliminated the corresponding figure, so this comment is no longer relevant.

> 4. Discussion
>
> The discussion is pretty good. Specific quibbles:
>
> a. Line 270, “...confounding factor in characterizing…: Why?

This part of the discussion has been re-written, so this comment is no longer relevant.

> b. Line 273: Figure out something to say other than “formal framework.”

We no longer use the word "framework" here or anywhere else in the discussion or conclusions.

> c. Line 295: drop the dash in within-PFTs

We have revised this accordingly.

> d. Line 299: not “incur.” Maybe “foster”?

In the re-written discussion, this comment is no longer relevant.

> e. Line 324: LMA was orthogonal to N? Really? I don’t recall your emphasizing that in your results, and it’s certainly not the case for the results of the hierarchical model.

In the new results and discussion, this comment is not longer relevant.

> f. Paragraphs starting at line 340: this is the strongest part your discussion and is really good

Since these paragraphs worked well, we did not re-write them completely, but adapted them to fit our revised results.

# Reviewer 3

> This is a technically proficient manuscript in many respects, with some strong features, about an important topic.
It generally is written well and quantitatively well done, but – somewhat surprisingly to me given the overall high quality of the work – it seems to have been formulated in a way that leads to several problems.
>
> The paper addresses an important question – whether trait trade-offs and associated trait relationships are similar or different among different plant functional types and biomes.  
The model approach (from simple univariate, to multivariate to hierarchical) is parsimonious and clear.
The main issues involve the number of PFTs used in the analyses (35), and how they were defined; and the curious absence of much biological or ecological thought about whether, why, and how trait relationships vary among major plant life forms and across biogeographic gradients.
This latter (and missing) component of the paper would seem to be essential for a contribution to New Phytologist, or for that matter, for any journal.
The former issue (35 PFTs) is problematic in terms of how one might interpret the results of the analyses, as I will discuss below.
Together they contribute to several concerns or ‘missing’ elements for the paper.
>
> 1. There are a number of concerns about the PFT classification.
>
> a) With 35 PFTs, many of the sample sizes (Table 1) are far too low for any kind of reliable estimates within PFTs and comparisons among PFTs.
Given the authors’ interests in PFTs and not in species per se, I would think a minimum cut-off of 10 or 12 or more species would be useful.
That means almost one-fourth of the cases in Table 1 are insufficient.
It is also not clear how many of the measurements of the five columns with trait data that follow came from each species.
I read number of species as the number for ANY data (any column value), not for all.
Thus, with species =12, the number of species for LL or Pmass or Rd might be 3 or 11.
Authors should put those values in parentheses next to the numbers of observations.
If there are 38 observation and 35 came from one species that does not seem a useful test at the PFT scale, even though the total number of observations is good.
If number of observations of a given trait in a given PFT is 11, but from 3 species, that also is marginally useful in this context.
We need to know more about this as a reader and I think the authors need to eliminate many PFT categories where number of species and/or observations and/or unique species-observation counts are low.

See response to first editor comment and issue 3 of reviewer 1 (above).

> b) Why is growth form and leaf type missing for PS scheme C4?? I assume we know this information (and likely they are mostly herbaceous, broadleaved, yes?)?  Given the low numbers of C4 species in every biome other than temperate, is this a useful class in any case?

This comment is no longer relevant in the context of our revised PFT scheme.

> c) Whether a plant is tropical or boreal is a description of where it lives on Earth.
It is important and potentially useful, but the framework for how to think about the different aspects of the different components of the PFTs is missing.

We have addressed this by defining climate zones in terms of mean annual temperature cutoffs, and placing species into climate zones based on the average mean annual temperature of all sites that they are present in TRY.
We describe this in the methods (section 2.2, "Plant Functional Types").

> d) What they call “biome” is really more a “climate zone”.
These biomes and PFTs don’t map out on to traditional biomes or IGBP-DIS biomes (see Woodward et al 2004) or biomes or PFTs used in models such as CLM or CABLE or JULES.
The ‘arid’ biome is strange as usually there is either a desert or a grassland biome or both, and unless I missed it, I don’t see how they defined a biome as arid.
I have no problem with them making up a new classification but the rationale behind it needs to be stated and the rules clear. 
Many other PFTs distinguish trees from shrubs.
It is ok not to do so, but why not?
Why include CAM when the data are so scarce and only in one biome (and missing leaf type, growth form, and phenology).
Does any information about CAM and arid climates become hopelessly confounded if this one photosynthetic type is only found in one climate region?
In general the classification – so key to the entire paper – is kind of a mess.

See response to first editor comment (above).
In general, we agree that our original PFT classification was not done well, and we have addressed this by following the PFT classification scheme used by the Community Land Model, and by more clearly documenting the rules we used for assigning attributes like climate zone and growth form to specific PFTs.

> 2. Conceptual concerns
>
> Even more problematic from my standpoint is the lack of hypotheses about biology and ecology.
From first principles, the authors need to lay out a foundation regarding our thinking about why a given growth form, leaf type, PS scheme, or phenology should differ (or not) from another in terms of relationships of trait Y to trait X?
For example should needle-leaved species have similar or different LMA-Nmass relationship as broad-leaved species from the same climate zone?
How should they differ, and why?
This kind of question applies to every kind of contrast (e.g., woody, nonwoody; evergreen, deciduous; needle-leaved, broadleafed; tropical, temperate).
By laying out hypotheses about what we might expect to see, testing that with the data, and interpreting how to think about support for or refutation of those hypotheses, the authors would advance the field.
Unfortunately this is almost entirely lacking in the paper.

We have added more text about mechanisms imparting scale dependence on the leaf economic spectrum to the introduction and discussion.
In the latter, we highlight several specific cases where we observed patterns unique to certain PFTs and the ecophysiological basis for these idiosyncracies.

> 3. Value for modeling

> The authors pitch this work as useful to models, rather than useful from a biological concept framework.
But, most earth system models use only a small number of PFTs (e.g., 5 or more recently 9 in JULES, Harper et al. 2016; or 14 in CLM Bonan et al 2011, etc.) and define those PFTs in ways that don’t easily match what was done in this paper.

We have addressed this concern by directly adapting the PFT scheme used by CLM.
We demonstrate the applicability of the approach by directly comparing our parameter estimates to those listed in the CLM manual (section 4.1, "Variation in trait means among PFTs") in the discussion, as well as to other studies similarly aimed at providing revised parameter estimates for ecosystem models.

> As a result of these issues (particularly 1 and 2), I don’t find much of the major contrasts useful in terms of advancing understanding; e.g.,  I find Figures 3 and 4 useless in their present form.
They don’t advance our understanding of the underlying plant biology or ecology, nor do they advance our quantitative description of how the trends vary, as the 35 choices are far too many to be useful given the sample size and structure (not enough observations, not enough species).
I also don’t think they are useful for modeling, given the extremely high number of PFTs.

All of the figures and analyses for this paper have been completely re-done, and the results were significantly different as a result.
In the discussion section, we highlight specific contrasts among PFTs in terms of both mean estimates and trait correlations, and, particularly for the latter, suggest ecophysiological rationale for those differences.
