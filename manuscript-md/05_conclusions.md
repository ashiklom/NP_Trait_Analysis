# Conclusions

One aspect of ecology that makes it challenging is that no two organisms are identical and will respond in identical ways to external stimuli. 
Functional diversity research fundamentally depends on dimensionality reduction through a search for meaningful pattern that can be exploited to take reasonable guesses at average behavior. 
The trait trade-offs comprising the leaf economic spectrum are one such pattern. 
In this paper, we reaffirm the existence of the leaf economic spectrum both globally and, with some caveats, within plant functional types, and show how leaf economic relationships can be leveraged to inform trait estimates, particularly at small sample sizes.
We also highlight how the strength of leaf economic relationships can be influenced by biotic and abiotic factors specific to certain PFTs.

We foresee tremendous potential of multivariate and hierarchical modeling approaches to elucidating the role of functional traits in organismal and ecosystem function. 
Besides the many important foliar traits that we did not include (e.g. pigment contents, leaf hydraulic traits), our approach could readily be applied to other plant traits whose relationship to the leaf economic spectrum is less clear. 
One example is hydraulic traits: While stem and leaf hydraulic traits are correlated [@bartlett_hydraulic], a potential scaling between hydraulic and leaf economic traits is poorly understood [@reich_world-wide_2014; @li_leaf_2015]. 
Similarly, reexamining the relationships defining wood [@chave_woodeconomics; @baraloto_decoupled_2010; @fortunel_leaf_2012] and root [@kramer-walter_root_2016; @valverde-barrantes_root_2016] economic spectra, as well as their relationship to the foliar traits, would provide useful information on possible scale-dependence of plant growth and allocation strategies.
We emphasize that the relative difficulty of measuring hydraulic and other non-foliar traits [e.g @jansen_hydraulic_traits] further increases the value of any technique that can fully leverage the information they provide. 
More generally, multivariate and hierarchical modeling has the potential to reveal functional trade-offs that are mutually confounding at different scales, thereby enhancing our understanding of processes driving functional diversity.
